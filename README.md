## STEPS FOR SIMULATION:
Open the Ltspice software

FileNew Schematic

Click component symbol to browse and select the components

Find the diode or diodes from the component list and place them.

Click OK and place the component

Search for resistor from component menu or from the tab icons

Place the resistors

Search for capacitor from the component menu or from the tab icons

Place the capacitors

Use ctrl + R to rotate the components

Use wire symbol to connect the components as per the circuit diagram

Right click each components to give the values

Use run button to run the simulation

Set the step time and click ok

Output dialog box will open

In the output dialog box right click and select add traces

Node voltages and current of each components names will be displayed.

Select the required node voltages (V(n001)) to get the waveforms.

To get the voltage across a component the name of the trace should represent both the nodes. example V(n001,n002))
